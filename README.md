# PythonProj


# In short, This project is a Python-GUI application, intended to generate monsters for a DnD 5e campaign.

# More granularly, I would like to create an interactive parent popup which launches when the py is initiated in visual studio code. This parent popup will be capable to generating child popups, each housing info and stats on a single monster.


# Parent Console Details: A parent popup will generate a child popup whenever a monster is 'deployed'. Ideally, the parent popup will have custom, random, and preset monster designs, allowing the user to create or import their monster and deploy it for live (manual) combat stat-tracking.


# Child Pane Details: A child pane will be generated whenever a user determines that a monster is ready for combat; ideally initialized by a GUI button. After initialization from the parent, A resizeable popup window will be generated that clones the parent, many of the features becoming read-only and other features duplicating to allow edits while still displaying the original data (ie a 'healthbar' in the parent can be create and in the child it becomes a fraction to allow users to manipulate the monsters' "current HP" while tracking the starting point).
